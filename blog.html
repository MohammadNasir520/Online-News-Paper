                            What is the VAR Variable in JS?
                            <br>
                            Var variable is the old way to declare a variable in javascript; var variable has the
                            function
                            scope, But global scope when it is declared outside the function.

                            scope of var variable
                            <br>
                            When we declare a var variable outside the function, it will have the global scope and will
                            be
                            available to use everywhere inside the whole program.

                            <br>

                            Let variable introduce a special feature that does not allow
                            re-declaration of
                            variables, if you
                            remember, re-declaration was a problem in var variable but let variable solve this problem.

                            scope of let variable

                            The let variable have block scope, meaning let variable will be accessible only inside the
                            block
                            it's
                            declared if we try of access outside of the scope it will show Reference Error.

                            What is the Const variable in JS?
                            <br>

                            The new version of javascript (ES6) introduces two new methods of declaring variables in
                            javascript,
                            one was using the const keyword to declare constant variables.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            const declarations are block-scoped
                            <br>
                            Const variable also has the Block scope like let variable, const variable also can't be
                            accessed
                            outside of the scope.

                <div class="my-4">
                    <h4 class="text-center">2.Difference between arrow function and regular function</h4>
                    <p>Syntax
                        <br>
                        The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their
                        syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return
                        shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Execution context
                        <br>
                        Inside a regular function, execution context (i.e. the value of this) is dynamic. This means
                        that the value of this depends on how the function was invoked (simple invocation, method
                        invocation, indirect invocation or constructor invocation). On the other hand, an arrow function
                        does not define its own execution context. This results in an arrow function's this being
                        resolved lexically (i.e. the scope in which the arrow function was defined).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Constructors
                        <br>
                        Regular functions can be used as constructors, using the new keyword. Yet another consequence of
                        the lexical resolution of this inside arrow functions is that they cannot be used as
                        constructors. Using new with an arrow function results in a TypeError.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        map
                        <br>
                        map works like for of loop and return value automitacali.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        forEach
                        <br>
                        forEach also works like for of loop but forEach does nor return anything.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        filter
                        <br>
                        The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a
                        function.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        find
                        <br>
                        The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method
                        executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements
                        are found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
